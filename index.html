          challenges that I've passionately built during my journey as a
          <i>web developer</i>. These projects are speciffically focused on
          <i>Front-end web development</i>, and they reflect my skills,
          creativity, and dedication to coding using
          <code>Front-end technologies</code>, such as <code>HTML</code>,
          <code>CSS3</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>React</code>, and
          other Frameworks and Libraries. They range from simple components to
          complex systems, each with its own unique challenges and learning
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each project includes a brief description, the technologies used, and
          the challenges faced during development. Feel free to explore each
          project to learn more about my work and my capabilities as a web
          developer.

          <div class="sect-content">
            <p>
              This project was made possible by using
              <code>HTML5</code> and <code>CSS3</code>. I used
              <code>CSS Flexbox</code> which let you arrange things on a web
              site in different ways. It made this component look nice and neat
              on different screen sizes, such as computers, tablets, or phones.

              This project was built by using <code>HTML5</code> and
              <code>CSS3</code>. <code>CSS Flexbox</code> was used to layout out
              the project which in return made it look nice and neat.

            <p>
              This project was a little challenging, but likely with the help of
              <code>HTML5</code> and <code>CSS3</code>, I managed to pull it off
              and the end result look fantastic! <code>Flexbox</code> was the
              main layout method utilized to organized everthing together.

          <div class="sect-content">
            <p>
              Creating this tip calculator app involves structuring the app with
              <code>HTML</code>, styling it with <code>CSS</code>, and adding
              functionality with <code>JavaScript</code>. Itâ€™s a great project
              for understanding how these three technologies work together to
              create a dynamic web application. To make it responsive I combined
              of Flexbox with Grid.
